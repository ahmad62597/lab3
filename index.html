        <h2>Hey Guys!</h2>

        <p>Welcome to my personal page. I hope you enjoy learning more about me!</p>

        <p>One of the few things people don't know about me, or find rather strange is that
            I actually don't listen to music. I won't ever be the one to sit down and just begin
            to play some music for my own enjoymenet as it actually gives me a headache.

        <h3>Chicago</h3>
            <p>
                Chicago was a turning point for me in my life. When I was about 13 years old, my parents and I decided to begin a traditional religious journey for myself, as I was somewhat derailed at that age. I spent about 2 years in Chicago in a boarding school, hopping from the suburbs to southern and west Chicago during my time there. Alas, Chicago wasn't the perfect place for me and I ended up pursuing my religious education in Canada.

        <h4>Canada</h4>
            <p>
                Canada was cold. Really cold. Beautiful. But cold. It was also where I really learned about myself and how to be a better person overall. I think if I didn't spend my high school years in Canada, I would have been a much more terrible person than I am now. It might be interesting, but a lot of my likes and dislikes were devoloped during my time in Canada. Like my dislike for coffee was originated in Canada.
