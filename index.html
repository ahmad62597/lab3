            <p>Welcome to my personal page. I hope you enjoy learning more about me!</p>
            
            <p>One of the few things people don't know about me, or find rather strange is that 
                I actually don't listen to music. I won't ever be the one to sit down and just begin
                to play some music for my own enjoymenet as it actually gives me a headache.
